This is the WP Forms Test page.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* Ruby
* Sass
* Node.js

## Plugin development

THis page uses [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine, navigate to the plugin directory then run `npm install`:

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/your-file-name
$ npm install
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `grunt watch` — Compile Sass assets and watch for changes.
* `grunt sass` — Compile Sass files
